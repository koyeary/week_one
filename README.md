Solutions for homework assignment week one - accessibility standards
Mock-up of “Horiseon” SEO Management site

## Modifications
To meet the acceptance criteria, I made the following modifications:
	A concise, descriptive title 
	
	Made heading attributes sequential

	Created descriptive, concise “alt” text for each of the images—I included alt text for the icons in the “aside” column, but 		I believe they should be invisible to screen-readers as they are more decorative than informative
	
	Implemented HTML5 semantics to meet accessibility standards
	
	“Tidied up” source code for readability, including consolidating repetitive CSS stylings.

--
As a bonus, because we’re working on accessibility, I started to familiarize myself with ARIA standards and added a couple ARIA attributes (tabindex=#, aria-label) to improve screen-reader functionality. But that project is by no means complete.

Obviously it’s not scaleable, but it looks nice on the desktop
